		<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
		
		<para><command>sponge</command> reads standard input and
			writes it out to the specified file. Unlike a shell
			redirect, sponge soaks up all its input before
			opening the output file. This allows constructing
			pipelines that read from and write to
			the same file.</para>
		<para>
			It also creates the output file
			atomically by renaming a temp file into place,
			and preserves the permissions of the output file
			if it already exists.
			If the output file is a special file or symlink,
			the data will be written to it.</para>
		<para>If no output file is specified, sponge outputs to
			stdout.</para>
