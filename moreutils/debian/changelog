moreutils (0.28) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved to a git repository.
  * vidir: Applied patch from Stefan Fritsch (one part of #412176):
    - Check for control characters (especially newlines) in filenames
      and error out, since this can greatly confuse the editor or vidir.
    - If the source of a rename does not exist (and thus the rename will fail
      anyway), vidir should not move an existing target file to a tmpfile.
    - If a directory is renamed, vidir should take that into account when
      renaming files in this directory.
    - If a directory name is passed as name/ to vidir, vidir should not
      add second slash after the name.
  * vidir: Add support for unlinking directories. To recursivly delete
    a directory and its contents, pipe find to vidir, and delete the directory
    and its contents in the editor. Closes: #412176
  * Add example to man page about recursive modification of directories.

moreutils (0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove notes about potential tools from README, moved to wiki.
  * vidir: Don't abort if it sees an empty or all-whitespace line.
  * vidir: If just a filename is removed and the number is left,
    treat this the same as removing the whole line, and delete the file,
    instead of trying to rename the file to "".
  * vidir: Remove the periods after the item numbers.
  * vidir: Man page improvements. Closes: #378122
  * combine: Man page improvements, to clarify even more that order does
    matter and that the operations are not commutative. Closes: #361123
  * combine: The behavior of "or" was fairly strange if lines were repeated in
    a file. Changed behavior to just print all lines from both files, even
    if this means printing dups. Not sure I like this behavior either, but
    it's consistent with the very useful behaviors of "and" and "not".
  * vidir, vipe: Use /usr/bin/editor if it's present, and EDITOR and VISUAL
    arn't set, to comply with Debian policy. For portability, fall back to vi
    if there's no /usr/bin/editor. Closes: #378623
