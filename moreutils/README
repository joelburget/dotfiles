This is a collection of the unix tools that nobody thought to write
long ago, when unix was young. Currently it consists of these tools:

chronic: runs a command quietly unless it fails
combine: combine the lines in two files using boolean operations
errno: look up errno names and descriptions
ifdata: get network interface info without parsing ifconfig output
isutf8: check if a file or standard input is utf-8
ifne: run a command if the standard input is not empty
lckdo: execute a program with a lock held (deprecated)
mispipe: pipe two commands, returning the exit status of the first
parallel: run multiple jobs at once
pee: tee standard input to pipes
sponge: soak up standard input and write to a file
ts: timestamp standard input
vidir: edit a directory in your text editor
vipe: insert a text editor into a pipe
zrun: automatically uncompress arguments to command

Its web page is here: http://kitenet.net/~joey/code/moreutils/

Your suggestions of additional tools to add to this collection are
appreciated. The web page lists some that are under consideration but
have not yet been included, I also welcome feedback on which of these to
include.
